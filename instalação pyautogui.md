Installation
To install PyAutoGUI, install the pyautogui package from PyPI by running pip install pyautogui (on Windows) or pip3 install pyautogui (on macOS and Linux). (On macOS and Linux, pip refers to Python 2â€™s pip tool.)

OS-specific instructions are below.

Windows
On Windows, you can use the py.exe program to run the latest version of Python:

py -m pip install pyautogui
If you have multiple versions of Python installed, you can select which one with a command line argument to py. For example, for Python 3.8, run:

py -3.8 -m pip install pyautogui
(This is the same as running pip install pyautogui.)


Linux
On macOS and Linux, you need to run python3:

python3 -m pip install pyautogui
On Linux, additionally you need to install the scrot application, as well as Tkinter:

sudo apt-get install scrot

sudo apt-get install python3-tk

sudo apt-get install python3-dev
